# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Focus: Physics simulation and environment building.

This module covers physics simulation and environment building using Gazebo and Unity. Students will learn to simulate physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo, as well as high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity. The module also covers simulating sensors such as LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Set up and configure physics simulation environments
- Create and import robot models using URDF and SDF
- Simulate various sensors (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs)
- Implement domain randomization techniques
- Bridge simulation to real-world robotic systems (Sim-to-Real)

### Module Structure

This module contains the following topics:
- Physics simulation in Gazebo
- Environment creation and modeling
- Sensor simulation and integration
- Unity for robot visualization
- Synthetic data generation

### Prerequisites

Students should have:
- Understanding of basic physics concepts
- Familiarity with 3D modeling concepts
- Basic understanding of ROS/ROS 2
