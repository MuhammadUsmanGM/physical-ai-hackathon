# What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional digital AI systems to intelligent agents that operate in and interact with the physical world. Unlike conventional AI models that process data in virtual environments, Physical AI systems must understand and navigate the complexities of real-world physics, sensorimotor interactions, and embodied intelligence.

## Key Characteristics of Physical AI

- **Embodied Intelligence**: AI systems that exist within a physical form, whether simulated or real, with sensors and actuators
- **Real-World Interaction**: Systems that can perceive, reason, and act in physical environments
- **Physics Understanding**: Comprehension and utilization of physical laws, forces, and material properties
- **Sensorimotor Integration**: Coordination between sensory input and motor output for effective action

## The Convergence of Technologies

Physical AI brings together multiple disciplines:

- **Robotics**: Providing the mechanical and control foundations
- **Artificial Intelligence**: Enabling perception, reasoning, and decision-making
- **Computer Vision**: Allowing robots to understand visual input from the world
- **Natural Language Processing**: Facilitating human-robot communication
- **Control Theory**: Ensuring stable and efficient physical interactions
