# The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Module Overview

This module covers physics simulation and environment building using Gazebo and Unity. Students will learn to simulate physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo, as well as high-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity. The module also covers simulating sensors such as LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Set up and configure physics simulation environments
- Create and import robot models using URDF and SDF
- Simulate various sensors (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs)
- Implement domain randomization techniques
- Bridge simulation to real-world robotic systems (Sim-to-Real)

### Module Structure

This module contains the following topics:
- Physics simulation in Gazebo
- Environment creation and modeling
- Sensor simulation and integration
- Unity for robot visualization
- Synthetic data generation

### Prerequisites

Students should have:
- Understanding of basic physics concepts
- Familiarity with 3D modeling concepts
- Basic understanding of ROS/ROS 2
