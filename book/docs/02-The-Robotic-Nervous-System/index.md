# The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Module Overview

This module introduces ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the middleware that serves as the nervous system for robotic applications. Students will learn to develop distributed robotic systems using ROS 2's communication patterns, package management, and development tools.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Understand ROS 2 architecture and core concepts (Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions)
- Create and build ROS 2 packages with Python and C++
- Implement communication patterns between robotic components
- Use launch files and parameter management for complex systems
- Debug and monitor ROS 2 systems effectively

### Module Structure

This module contains the following topics:
- ROS 2 Architecture and Fundamentals
- Nodes, Topics, and Services
- Building ROS 2 packages with Python
- Launch files and parameter management
- Debugging and monitoring tools

### Prerequisites

Students should have:
- Basic programming experience in Python
- Understanding of distributed systems concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line
