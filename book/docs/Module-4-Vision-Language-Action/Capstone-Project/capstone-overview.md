# Humanoid Capstone Project Overview

The Humanoid Capstone Project represents the culmination of your Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics journey, integrating all the concepts learned across the course modules into a comprehensive, functional humanoid robot system. This project challenges you to apply ROS 2 fundamentals, simulation techniques, NVIDIA Isaac platform capabilities, and AI integration to create an intelligent, embodied system capable of natural human interaction.

## Project Goals and Objectives

The primary goals of this capstone project are to:

1. **Demonstrate Integration**: Combine all course modules (ROS 2, Simulation, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA) into a cohesive system
2. **Develop Practical Skills**: Apply theoretical knowledge to build and operate a humanoid robot system
3. **Implement AI-Physical World Integration**: Create a system that bridges digital intelligence with physical embodiment
4. **Foster Innovation**: Encourage creative solutions to complex humanoid robotics challenges

## Capstone Project Deliverables

**Core System Components**:
- Functional humanoid robot system (simulated or hardware-based)
- Integrated perception and navigation stack
- Human-robot interaction capabilities
- Voice command processing and execution

**Documentation**:
- System architecture and design documentation
- Code repositories with comprehensive comments
- Performance evaluation and testing reports
- User manual for system operation

**Demonstration**:
- Live system demonstration (in simulation or on hardware)
- Video presentation showcasing key capabilities
- Technical presentation explaining design decisions

## Timeline and Milestones

The capstone project follows a structured timeline spanning the final weeks of the course:

**Week 11**: Project planning, team formation, and platform selection
**Week 12**: Implementation and integration of core capabilities
**Week 13**: Testing, refinement, and presentation preparation
