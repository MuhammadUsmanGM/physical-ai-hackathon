# The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

## Module Overview

This module focuses on NVIDIA Isaac, which provides photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation through Isaac Sim, and hardware-accelerated perception and navigation through Isaac ROS. Students will learn about VSLAM (Visual SLAM) and path planning for bipedal humanoid movement using Nav2.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Use NVIDIA Isaac Sim for photorealistic robot simulation
- Implement hardware-accelerated perception using Isaac ROS
- Apply VSLAM (Visual SLAM) techniques for navigation
- Utilize Nav2 for path planning in humanoid systems
- Deploy AI models to NVIDIA hardware platforms

### Module Structure

This module contains the following topics:
- NVIDIA Isaac SDK and Isaac Sim
- Isaac ROS: Hardware-accelerated perception
- VSLAM (Visual SLAM) for navigation
- Nav2: Path planning for humanoid movement
- AI model deployment and optimization

### Prerequisites

Students should have:
- Understanding of basic perception concepts
- Experience with deep learning frameworks
- Knowledge of NVIDIA GPU platforms
